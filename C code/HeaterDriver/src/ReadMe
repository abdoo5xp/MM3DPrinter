This is a Heater Driver. this driver is in HAL layer. 
This Heater Driver operates using PWM from timer 4.
The Driver initially will be able to output a PWM signal on Channel 1 ; however, this can be re-configured later.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
For changing Channels used in timer 4:
/* options are :>> 1,2,3,4,All
 * Timer 4 channel  1:>> PB6  (not available in stm kit)
 * Timer 4 channel  2:>> PB7
 * Timer 4 channel  3:>> PD14
 * Timer 4 channel  4:>> PD13 (not available in stm kit)
 * use Channel 3 or 4 if you want to connect on the other side of the board */
 --------------------------------------------------------------- 
 /*No of Ticks = Timer_Tick_freq / Desired Frequency*/
 We are working with 84,000,000 Hz and the available prescaler are:>> .../64/128
 Since TIM3 and TIM4 are 16-bit timers, max value for timer = 65535.
  
 Depending on the material of the heater and the characteristics of the mosfet, the frequency of the PWM
 signal that can affect the heater coil can be decided. Until this calculation is done, we can provide 
 calculation for the range of frequencies:>> 
 100Hz  -> prescaler /128, ticks in register: 6563
 1KHz   -> prescaler /128, ticks in register: 656
 
 10KHz -> prescaler /128, ticks in register:  66
 		OR
 	   -> prescaler /64, ticks in register:  131
 	   
 100KHz -> prescaler /64, ticks in register: 13
